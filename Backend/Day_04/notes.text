what mean by server: 
    client/user:- jisko services chahiye(jo data ko reques krega)
    server:jo data ko dega
    socket:combination of ip address + port no
    (replay milne ke baad socket remove ho jata hai or phir new req ke liye now socket bnta h)

http: 80 (port no)
https:443 (port no)

server listen: http server 80 port no pr listen kr rha hai ka matlab 80 no port pr koi request too nhi kr rha hia

why we need port not:it define which application i show your request(device ke ander bhut sare app h to kon se app me data show krana hai ye port no se decide hota hai)

❓ What is the problem in JavaScript (normal JS) for creating a server?
✅ JavaScript normally runs only in the browser.

That means:

It can only handle frontend — showing buttons, images, forms, etc.

It cannot access files, databases, or network ports — so it cannot create or manage a server.

👉 So normal JavaScript can't create a backend server.

🛠 Why we use Node.js to solve this?
Node.js gives JavaScript the power to run outside the browser, on your computer/server.

With Node.js, you can:

Create a web server

Connect to a database

Handle API requests

Read/write files

Do anything like Python, PHP, or Java
